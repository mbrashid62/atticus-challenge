# Atticus Challenge

This app was created Vite's getting started script. It supports React, TypeScript, and Vite.

To run it locally, simply run `yarn && yarn dev`.

## More Time

- I would clean up the data flow. It would be nice to move evertyhing to React Context so that there's not as much prop-drilling and callback chains required
- There are a few UX quirks. I would want to allow a user to create a playlits without selecting songs and add multiple songs at a time
- I would allow a user to delete a playlist
- I would allow a user to edit the name of the playlist.
- I would ensure things are responsive and fucntional on mobile and multiple browsers
- I would add unit tests
